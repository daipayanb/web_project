# My Projects

**ANZ Cyber@ANZ Virtual Internship | May 2020**

Investigated a set of emails for any kind of malicious content, suspicious URLs or Phishing attempts to gather private information.
Analyzed a packet capture file using Wireshark and Hexeditor to identify and investigate any potential threats.

**OverTheWire Bandit & NATAS | Python, Bash scripting, Burp Suite | January 2020** 

Took up the challenge of solving Bandit and NATAS CTF to get more hands on with common tools required for Penetration testing. 

**ENPM685 Pentesting Final Project| Metasploit, msfvenom, hashcat, mimikatz, Powershell scripting | December 2019**

The final project expected us to exploit vulnerabilities and gain access to the 4 VMs on the Network to retrieve the final flag. This involved attacking using Metasploit, generating encrypted payloads using msfvenom to evade antivirus installations, escalate to root privileges, pivot to other VMs on the network and maintain persistence.

**OverTheWire Behemoth | Python, Bash scripting, gdb, strace, ltrace | November 2019**

As part of the “Hacking of C Programs & Unix Binaries” coursework the challenge was taken up to solve the Behemoth CTF. This involved binary analysis and exploitation techniques such as Buffer Overflows, Format String attacks. Few of the levels also required exploitation of common Linux binaries’ vulnerabilities. 

**Optimized Touch B.Eng. Project | Java, Android | May 2017**

Minimizing errors caused while selecting on-screen targets by senior citizens and patients of Parkinson’s disease. An Android keyboard was developed which suggests corrections based on the user’s movement and how much the user’s finger trembles.

**Encrypted Email Service | Python, ast, smtplib, Crypto | August 2016**

A Python application that lets users send encrypted emails and decrypt them. Users continued to use their own service providers. The email communications remained encrypted in the service provider’s servers. Hybrid Encryption (RSA and AES) was implemented to encrypt the contents of the email.
